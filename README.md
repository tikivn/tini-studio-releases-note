# Tini Studio IDE Release Notes

Public repository for release notes of Tini Studio IDE

## Development guildeline

To create release notes, we need to update release.md file and create new tag and then push it to github.

Tag name format: `{tini studio prod version}` 
Example tag name: `1.35` 

> Notes: 
> * No prefix "`v`" in tag name
> * Only create release tag for production release

Tini Studio then will automatically fetch and show new release notes
